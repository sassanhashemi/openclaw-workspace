# Memory Log: 2026-02-17

## Git & Repository Setup
- Expanded git repo from workspace/ to full .openclaw/ directory
- Created auto-push system using fswatch - pushes changes within 5 seconds
- Deploy key added to github.com/sassanhashemi/openclaw-workspace
- Now tracking: logs/, agents/, cron/, devices/, identity/, workspace/
- Excluded from git: credentials/, tokens, browser data, telegram sessions

## To-Do System
- Created daily to-do list system in workspace/todo/
- Files: YYYY-MM-DD.md format
- Cron job set for 8 PM daily to check incomplete tasks
- User decides what moves to next day (no auto-move)
- Feb 17 tasks: 3/9 complete (Meditate, Upper day at Bay Club, RFBA emails)

## Email Issues & Changes
- avaopenclaw@outlook.com locked by Microsoft for "unusual activity" - requires verification
- New email identity: ava@sassan.ai (Office 365)
  - Password stored in .credentials/outlook-ava-sassan.txt
  - Account doesn't exist yet in Microsoft's system - needs verification from Sassan
  - Attempting to use via browser (outlook.office.com) until Apple Mail can be configured

## Model Changes
- Switched from Opus 4.5 back to Sonnet 4.5 per request

## Persistent Issue: Error Messages
- Corrected AGAIN (3rd time) for showing raw error messages
- Updated LESSONS-LEARNED.md with critical warning
- Must internalize: Try A/B/C silently, only report success or clean explanation
- This keeps happening - needs permanent fix

## System Configuration
- Mac mini: 16GB RAM, Apple M4 (10 cores)
- Running 24/7 with auto-push background service
- Obsidian setup for workspace viewing (optional for user)

## Restaurant Research (from yesterday)
- Found 5 hidden gem restaurants near Ghirardelli Square for Feb 17 dinner
- Top picks: KAYMA Algerian (4.9★), Nisei (Michelin-starred), Leopold's, Sotto Mare, Italian Homemade Company
